Whenever I watch someone use their computer, I notice their personal setup and hacks. People collect these tools over time and eventually make up a unique and personal toolbox.

I'm sharing my personal toolbox and hopefully I inspire others to do the same!

### Productivity

- [**Jumpcut**](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/): Seems pretty limiting to only be able to paste the most recent item you copied somewhere. What if you wanted to paste that number you copied two times ago? Well, with Jumpcut, you can access up to 40 items from your clipboard! It's super lightweight and easy to use.

- [**Caffeine**](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/): I often find myself not wanting my Mac to go to sleep. Perhaps I'm running something that I absolutely can't kill or displaying something on the screen for a long period of time. Caffeine keeps your Mac awake with one click in the menu bar.

- [**Spectacle**](https://www.spectacleapp.com/): Makes it super easy to resize windows precisely or snap windows side-by-side.

### Fun

- [**Rocket**](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/): Slack makes it super easy to add emojis to a chat. It should be just as easy in other apps. Rocket brings slack style emoji entering everywhere. :raised-hands:
